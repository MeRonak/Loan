The program uses python's inbuilt library hashlib, from which the sha256 function is imported to convert the string input into the 256 bit output which in hexadecimal 
form is 64bit, next we use brute force approach to check for various values of nonce if it appended with the string input gives the output less than the target 
for checking the running time of the function I used the time library.
